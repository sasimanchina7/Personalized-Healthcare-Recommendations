## Building a Scalable Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System using Python & Big Data Pipelines
### Data set: 
Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year".

Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

The data is stored in datasets/transfusion.data and it is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM).

### Objective

Design and deploy a system that processes patient bloodwork data to generate personalized health insights and lifestyle recommendations using data engineering workflows and lightweight ML models.
